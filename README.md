# Angle recognition 

Master's thesis project - Condensed matter physics problems and deep learning solutions 

## Description

The main idea lies in leveraging deep learning techniques to recognize the shift angles between layers of Van der Waals heterostructures. In our specific case, the material in question is Nanoporous Graphene (NPG).
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is employed for imaging the graphene
layers, thus, enabling the detection of twisted bilayer and multilayer domains. On the simulation side, an analytic model is adopted to shed light on the number of misoriented layers, and their weak
interaction: for each layer we can write an accurate analytical form that can describe the in-plane density.

## Getting Started

### First step: dataset building 

The first thing to do is to build a dataset that physically represents the problem: The goal is to recognize how much two or more layers of a graphene-derived material are twisted relative to each other, as it is known that there are certain 'magic' angles at which particular properties are exhibited. The first step is to produce as many STM image simulations as possible and collect them in a dataset that links them to the twist angles for each layer
